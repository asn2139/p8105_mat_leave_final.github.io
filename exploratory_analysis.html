<p>This plot shows that mothers who are food insecure are clustered towards the lower side of family income. Mothers who are food insecure tend to have a family income less than 40,000. Mothers whose family income is between 16,001 and 20,000 tend to have the shortest amount of unpaid leave.</p>

<p>These visualizations shed light on the reason mothers were not back at work at the time of the survey. Choosing to stay at home was the most common response. However, it was disproportionately cited by mothers who were white and mothers who had a 4 year education or higher.</p>

<p>Across all income categories, over 90% of mothers received a postpartum check up 4-6 weeks after giving birth. Mothers with a lower family income were more likely to not get a postpartum check up.</p>
<p>These visualizations suggest there were not stark differences of leave by sociodemographic characteristics. However, New York City is a very heterogeneous city, with many pockets of inequality in close proximity. We then wanted to look at leave visually across zipcode. You can find that analysis here.</p>
